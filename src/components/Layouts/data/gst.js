            "description-2":"GST is a kind of indirect tax. Currently, Indian consumers have to pay indirect tax on goods and services such as Value Added Tax, Service Tax, Excise Duty, Customs Duty, etc. Under the current system, each State has a right to levy their own tax on the goods coming into their dominion for sale and consumption, while the Centre levies taxes on manufacture of the goods.

            "description-4":"Let us take an example of a dress manufactured in Surat, Gujarat. At the spot of manufacture, an excise duty/Cenvat has to be paid to the Central Government. If the dyes for the dress are bought from Madhya Pradesh, then the manufacturer has to pay the state taxes applicable for the dyes in Madhya Pradesh while buying it, and also pay Gujarat’s “import duty” on the product. Similarly, if the buttons for the dress are bought from Rajasthan, then another set of taxes are added to the manufacturing cost. At the end of this chain, when the product reaches the market for sale, VAT is added to it. So all the taxes paid for the production of the dress so far gets added to the cost of the dress, which rises considerably from its actual manufacturing cost.",
